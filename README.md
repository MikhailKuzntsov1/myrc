# My .rc files

## Nvim config

- My neovim config is written in mostly lua
- This config is compatible with both console Nvim & GUI versions 
- My preferred GUI is [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide)

## Credits
- Some things in `.vimrc` & `.tmux.conf` were stolen from my fellow S21 students 
[@reysand](https://github.com/reysand/dotfiles) and [@bezlant](https://github.com/bezlant). 
I'm grateful to you for making your dot files public.
It's definitely worth checking out these guys configs! :)
- [Christian Chiarulli @ChristianChiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) created awesome
tutorial on lua configuration of NeoVim. It is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&t=9s&ab_channel=chris%40machine). Many things in my NeoVim
are based on his tutorial.
